# Hospital Telephone Search Chatbot


**PhoneBookGPT** chatbot is designed to assist users in finding hospital telephone numbers quickly and efficiently. It uses a pre-defined PhoneBook to provide accurate information for various hospital departments and services.


## How to Use

1. Ask for a specific department's or service's telephone number.
2. The chatbot will respond with the requested information in the following format:

   **Department/Service Name** -> `Telephone Number`

3. If multiple results are found, they will be listed separately:

   **Department 1** -> `Telephone 1`
   **Department 2** -> `Telephone 2`

4. If the chatbot doesn't have the requested information, it will inform you that it doesn't know.

## Example Queries

- "CTER"
- "CT1"
- "1OW"

## Limitations

- The chatbot can only provide information that exists in its pre-defined phonebook.
- It cannot make appointments or connect calls directly.
- The chatbot does not have access to real-time updates of the phonebook.
